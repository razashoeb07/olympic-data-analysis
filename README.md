## ⚽️ Olympic Data Analysis  🌟

This project dives into the comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data, uncovering insights and trends using data visualization techniques.

## 📊 Key Features
- 🌟 In-depth exploration of Olympic data spanning multiple decades.
- ⚖️ Comparative analysis of medal counts by country, athlete performance, and sports.
- 📈 Visualization of trends such as participation, gender ratio, and event distribution.
- 📊 Utilizes Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- 🛠️ Interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** for intuitive data exploration.

## 💡 How It Works
1. Data is loaded from reliable sources and cleaned for accuracy.
2. Key insights are extracted using Pandas and NumPy.
3. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding.
4. The interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** allows users to explore insights dynamically.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🗒️ **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
